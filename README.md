Considering we have this map of Islamabad, where we want to know the path from the starting point, that is somewhere in G-6 to Destination point in F-8. We would like to get the fastest route possible to reach their.

In order to achieve it through A star, firstly, we would marks our map with paths and with their longtitude and lattitude values. For this example I have taken dummy values of longitude and lattitude.

By applying A star we will come up with the shortest path that is: A -> B -> F -> H -> K -> P -> X -> Z
